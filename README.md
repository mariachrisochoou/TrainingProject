# Magazine Viewer App
## Overview
This Android application, built in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, is designed as part of an interview selection process. 

The purpose of the app is to allow users to log in using a curated API, then retrieve and display a list of magazines grouped by month and year. Each magazine can be clicked on to view its title and download it by clicking on the associated image. 

The app is designed to follow modern Android development best practices using the ViewModel architecture for managing UI-related data lifecycle-consciously and Retrofit for API calls.
